Pathology diagnostics relies on the assessment of morphology by trained experts, which remains subjective and qualitative. Here we developed a framework for large-scale histomorphometry (FLASH) performing deep learning-based semantic segmentation and subsequent large-scale extraction of interpretable, quantitative, morphometric features in non-tumour kidney histology. We use two internal and three external, multi-centre cohorts to analyse over 1000 kidney biopsies and nephrectomies. By associating morphometric features with clinical parameters, we confirm previous concepts and reveal unexpected relations. We show that the extracted features are independent predictors of long-term clinical outcomes in IgA-nephropathy. We introduce single-structure morphometric analysis by applying techniques from single-cell transcriptomics, identifying distinct glomerular populations and morphometric phenotypes along a trajectory of disease progression. Our study provides a concept for Next-generation Morphometry (NGM), enabling comprehensive quantitative pathology data mining, i.e., pathomics. from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36173-0 Background Image-based machine learning tools hold great promise for clinical applications in pathology research. However, the ideal end-users of these computational tools (e.g., pathologists and biological scientists) often lack the programming experience required for the setup and use of these tools which often rely on the use of command line interfaces. Methods We have developed Histo-Cloud, a tool for segmentation of whole slide images (WSIs) that has an easy-to-use graphical user interface. This tool runs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation of WSIs in the cloud and allows the extraction of features from segmented regions for further analysis. Results By segmenting glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and vascular structures from renal and non-renal WSIs, we demonstrate the scalability, best practices for transfer learning, and effects of dataset variability. Finally, we demonstrate an application for animal model research, analyzing glomerular features in three murine models. Conclusions Histo-Cloud is open source, accessible over the internet, and adaptable for segmentation of any histological structure regardless of stain. from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00138-z Complex diseases are characterized by spatiotemporal cellular and molecular changes that may be difficult to comprehensively capture. However, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying pathology can shed light on disease mechanisms and progression. Here we introduce STARmap PLUS, a method that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with protein detection in the same tissue section. As proof of principle, we analyze brain tissues of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease at 8 and 13 months of age. Our approach provides a comprehensive cellular map of disease progression. It reveals a core–shell structure where disease-associated microglia (DAM) closely contact amyloid-β plaques, whereas disease-associated astrocyte-like (DAA-like) cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are enriched in the outer shells surrounding the plaque-DAM complex. Hyperphosphorylated tau emerges mainly in excitatory neurons in the CA1 region and correlates with the local enrichment of oligodendrocyte subtypes. The STARmap PLUS method bridges single-cell gene expression profiles with tissue histopathology at subcellular resolution, providing a tool to pinpoint the molecular and cellular changes underlying pathology. from: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01251-x 病理学检验是诸多疾病临床诊断的金标准，利用图像处理与人工智能技术对数字病 理图像进行分析，可以实现病灶的计算机辅助检测。在全扫描切片的情境下，可以进一 步获取更丰富的与肿瘤微环境、免疫微环境相关的信息，起到改进风险分层、支持治疗 决策等目的。数字病理图像分析的挑战主要来自于全扫描切片的数据体量、组织学与图 像外观的异质性、数据标注的昂贵代价，以及模型可解释性方面的需求。本文聚焦于基 于深度学习的数字病理图像分析系统，从细分领域综述、方法学研究，以及应用探索三 个方面展开工作，主要内容如下： 1、系统地总结了近期计算病理学领域的进展，并着重介绍了其在肺癌、结直肠癌、 乳腺癌切片，以及免疫组织化学染色切片和非肿瘤切片分析中的应用。在介绍相关知识 的同时，以前景识别任务为例展示了一套完整的计算病理学模型开发流程。 2、针对来自于组织学与图像外观多样性的挑战，提出了适用于大型队列的染色模式 分析工具。通过采样、聚类、色谱距离定义与求解，以及降维的步骤，对队列内全扫描 切片的颜色模式进行可视化。进一步以该方法为工具，分析了一个计算病理学模型的开 发与测试过程，得出了若干具有实践指导意义的结论。 3、针对标注数据收集代价高的挑战，提出了将深度预编码与逻辑斯蒂回归模型相结 合的方法。由于该方法的高效性，其得以集成于主动学习框架内，成为交互式标注的解 决方案。本文在三个大型数据集上验证了所提出方法的可行性，并针对编码器与主动学 习策略进行了深入的比较性研究。 4、开发了针对具体病种的计算病理学模型，并进行了有关模型的可解释性与临床意 义的探索： (a) 针对心内膜心肌活检组织病理图像，提出了临床心力衰竭检测模型，在训练VGG 模型实现病灶检测目的的同时，提出使用包括梯度-类别激活可视化技术、特征 空间的UMAP 降维，以及交叠式交叉验证等策略，提升模型输出的可解释性， 增强了信服力； (b) 针对结肠腺癌组织病理切片，提出了肿瘤微环境的自动分析方法，并验证了与肿 瘤间质、坏死、淋巴细胞相关指标的预后提示意义； (c) 针对肺癌组织病理图像，开发了基于 U-Net 的癌灶检测模型，并结合癌灶分割 结果与淋巴细胞空间分布图，提出了肿瘤与淋巴细胞交互程度的量化方法，并验 证了其预后意义。 关键词：数字病理图像，深度学习，计算病理学，计算机辅助诊断，肿瘤微环境，免 疫微环境，病灶检测 III Abstract Pathological examination is the golden standard of numerous diseases in clinics. Powered by image processing and artificial intelligence techniques, modern computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) models are able to detect lesions in histopathological images. In the context of whole-slide images, more information such as tumor microenvironment, immuno-microenvironment can be obtained. This information plays a crucial role in risk stratification and may support disease management. The challenges in digital pathological image analysis mainly include the huge data volume, the histological and apparent heterogeneity, the cost of data annotation, and the requirement of model interpretability. This thesis focuses on deep learning-based digital pathological image analytic systems, carries on the investigations from three aspects. The main contents are as follows: 1. We made a systematic summary of recent advances in computational pathology, with emphasis on its applications in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, immunohistochemistry-stained slides, and non-tumor disease. At the same time, we showed a full development procedure of a computational pathology model in the context of a foreground segmentation task. 2. To solve the challenge of histologic and apparent heterogeneity, we propose an analytic tool to visualize the staining pattern of large cohorts of digital slides. The method is composed of procedures including sampling, clustering, defining and solving distances between color spectrums, and dimensional reduction. Using this tool, we were able to analyze the development and deployment of a CAD model, leading to several conclusions that have practical guiding significance. 3. To deal with the expensiveness of data annotation, we propose to combine deep pre-encoding and logistic regression models. Because of the high efficiency, it can be integrated into an active learning framework, serving as a potential solution for interactive data annotation. We verified the method on three large-scale datasets, and conducted intensive comparative studies regarding the type of encoder and active learning strategy. 4. We developed a number of computational pathology models for specific diseases, and made investigations towards model interpretability and its clinical value. (a) We proposed a clinical heart failure detection model in endocardial myocardial biopsy images; along with the training of VGG models for detection task, we propose to use techniques including Grad-CAM, UMAP, and overlapped cross-validation to obtain interpretable predictions, adding convincement of the models. (b) We propose an automatic framework to quantify tumor microenvironment (TME) in Abstract IV colon adenocarcinoma slides, and verify the prognostic value of tumor stroma, necrosis, and lymphocytes distribution. (c) We also propose a U-Net-based model for cancer detection in lung specimens. Combined with the spatial distribution map of lymphocytes, we quantified the interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes, which turned out to has prognostic value.

It is common in malignant tumors such as colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. In terms of pathological pattern, the occurrence of adenocarcinoma is often accompanied by poor or undifferentiated gland structure. The glands are abnormally stretched and distorted, and the cavity structures are invaded by the nuclei, causing it to shrink or even disappear. This situation is directly related to the degree of malignancy of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the degree of differentiation of glandular structure is a decisive factor for pathologists to determine the grade of adenocarcinoma and decide the treatment plan in clinical pathological diagnosis. In this paper, to realize the automated grading of the malignant degree of adenocarcinoma, the study evolves from the degree of gland structure differentiation which is a pathological diagnostic criteria. On the one hand, this paper designs domain-specific hand-crafted features and proposes an automated gleason grading method for prostate adenocarcinoma based on the statistical representation of homology profile. This method first calculates the homology components of pathological images based on the homology profile algorithm, and quantifies the degree of gland structure differentiation by describing the topological arrangement of nuclei around the gland. Then it employs statistical methods for secondary characterization on the obtained homology sequence characteristics. The method finally models the weighted Knearest neighbor classifier algorithm for automated gleason grading of pathological images on adenocarcinoma. Experimental results show that this method performs better in grading and features robustness, compared with unsupervised learning method SSAE, supervised method DLGg and traditional pathomics-based method MATF. In addition, the proposed homology feature representation method has a strong biological basis and is highly interpretable. On the other hand, inspired by the idea of accurately describing the automatic segmentation of glandular structures for diagnosis, this paper proposes an automated assessment method for colorectal adenocarcinoma based on multi-task learning and prior knowledge. Firstly, this method employs the backbone network for feature extraction, and the extracted features are respectively sent to the segmentation branch and classification branch for automated gland structure segmentation and grading of adenocarcinoma images. Meanwhile, the automated Abstract III gland structure prediction from the segmentation branch acts as the prior knowledge, and it is encoded as spatial attention and merged into the classification branch to constrain the reasoning. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the prior knowledge-aware multi-task network, achieving the highest accuracy of 97.04% and AUC value of 0.9971 on the test set. Moreover, the idea of prior knowledge constraint in this paper is also interpretable. The automated assessment grading methods based on pathological image analysis are proposed for cancer malignancy. Importantly, the glandular structure differentiation acting as the pathological diagnosis criteria is fundamental to them. The methods thus can provide pathologists with interpretable auxiliary diagnosis support.

The traditional segmentation method is generally a manual or semi-automatic method, which is far from meeting the clinical needs in terms of segmentation efficiency or accuracy. Compared with natural images, pathological image recognition is more difficult. The current deep learning segmentation model still has the problem of low segmentation accuracy and robustness in the segmentation task of pathological images. The main reason for these problems is that the general deep learning segmentation model mainly relies on the pre-defined loss function training mechanism for training, so it cannot measure the error between the model output and the true label and guide the model training. In this paper, based on the basic principles of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN), segmentation models at the tissue and cell levels are constructed in a variety of pathological image analysis tasks. Based on the results of segmentation, many disease-related visual or sub-visual Visual features, and use these features for clinical auxiliary diagnosis and prognosis. In the pathological image analysis task, this paper constructed the following segmentation model and framework based on cGAN: (1) Constructed the semantic segmentation of nuclei in H &amp; E stained pathological images and the instance segmentation model SIcGAN, which can carry out precise semantics on all nuclei Segmentation; (2) Constructed an automatic segmentation model EPScGAN of epithelial and interstitial regions in H &amp; E stained pathological images of breast. Compared with the current mainstream image segmentation model, EPScGAN can achieve optimal segmentation performance; Detection and segmentation of myeloblast (Myeloblast) in the pathological smear of leukemia (AML), constructed the model and framework of AMLcGAN segmentation and detection, and then extracted the image features of Myeloblast based on the segmentation result of Myeloblast to be effective for bone marrow metastasis Sex was predicted. (4) For the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a megakaryocyte (Megakaryocyte) detection and segmentation model in CML stained pathological sections was constructed, and then the statistical characteristics of Megakaryocytes were extracted based on the segmentation results. diagnosis. 摘要 III (5) In the H &amp; E stained pathological image of oral cancer, a multi-cell nuclei (MN) segmentation and detection model MNSDcGAN was constructed, and tested in a total of 758 full-scan image (WSI) cases provided by multiple units, and finally found The extracted MN features are closely related to the 5-year survival rate of oral cancer patients.
